##  What I Wish I Knew About Data For Startups

For the last 4 years, I’ve been through quite a startup journey at PasswordBox. We went through multiple phases: launching our consumer product, raising a Series A, improving our product and optimizing, growing to millions of users and eventually getting acquired.

Throughout the journey, I’ve been part of the data team where I’ve been doing all things data: analysis, presentations, engineering, training, etc. We started with a very rudimentary stack to track and understand our product usage. Over time, we improved our infrastructure and our tooling. We built dashboards, data pipelines, reports etc. We invested heavily on the data culture. We trained our colleagues to leverage our tools to make better decisions with data.

In this talk, I want to share some of the learnings I've made in regards to building a data culture.
