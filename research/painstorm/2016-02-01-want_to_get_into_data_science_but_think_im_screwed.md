### Question
“want to get into data science, but think I’m screwed”
“math background only as far as Calc 3 and Linear Algebra, any hope getting into data science?”
“already earning about $110L a year”
“is there any real value in trying to jump onto a field with ppl with higher qualifications than someone who doesn’t have a super strong engineering/IT/DS background”
“I work FT and would like to get into DS”
“not sure how I would without entering a program or bootcamp”
“not sure career would move forward”

### Answers

“bootcamp won’t prepare you much”
“a proper program takes both time and money”
“get a job as a data specialist first”
“learn the ropes of the industry”

“who even hires for data specialist”
“first time I’ve hear that title”
“I have programming experience with softwares like Stats”
“I understand R and Python”
“not sure I could command a similar salary”

“data specialist is just a research assistant”
“salary probably halved”
“unrealistic to get a data science job with no experience and expect 110k”

“been working in social science research company”
“don’t have 0 experience”
“maybe the real question is, is this even worthwhile

“if you are already working with data, you’d better off to just add tools to your toolbox”
“work on more challenging projects within your company”
“take that experience to apply for an actual data-science job”
“better positioned to get a good salary”
“learning new tools”

“product-research roles tightly tied in with product teams”
“a lot of small-data panel work”
“find somewhere where the skills you have make money for your employer”
“data science is a very broad church”

“find analytics job at insurance company”

“a lot of position that don’t require math wizard”
“wouldn’t be a good fit for R&D at Google”
“maybe you’d git fine with a team that has more practical skills”
“never took any formal calculus”
“aced classes on neural networks by just conceptually understanding what a partial derivative is”
“haven’t entered industry but think I’ve got chops as I’ve been contacted by a couple recruiters”
“”

### Analysis
#### What hurts?
- Not sure about how to transition from FT to Data Science
- Not sure about having strong enough math background
- Scared of not having strong qualification (engineering/IT/DS)
- Not sure career would move forward - already earning $110k 
- Not sure if this career change is “worthwhile”, “would it really advance me forward at all?”
- Not sure he could command a similar salary taking a data science junior position

#### What do they buy?
- Considering program/bootcamp
- Data entry position

#### What do they want?
