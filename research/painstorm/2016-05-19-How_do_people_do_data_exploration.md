Question:
How do people do data exploration? Is this normal or am I just doing lots of unneeded work?
- Teach myself data science 
- Learning the tools 
- Reading books: calculus, linear algebra, data science, machine learning
- Listening to podcasts
- Trying to get involved in the community
- Need a break from heavy studying

Is this right?:

Answers:

- Write down your own conclusions
- Removing all blank cells at the end
- Plot using matplotlib or seaboard
- df.describe works better with numerical values

- Convert agree/disagree to 1 or 0
- Df[“series”].value_counts to automatically output the count of each value (normalize=True)
- See this guy for proper Pandas code: http://tomaugspurger.github.io/modern-1.html

- Plot everything
- My brillant statistics mentor advocated for plot, no matter how simple/complex the data is.
