Come from corporate background
Bachelor economics
5 years financial service
Excel skills
Basic Sas, sql, r
Built dashboards 
Ad-hoc reports
Khan Academy Algebra 2 , Trigonometry, Probability, Statistics

Plan:
- Quit job
- Study full-time: single variable calculus, probability, statistics, working knowledge of python, 

- After three months: enrol in General Assembly: https://generalassemb.ly/education/data-science-immersive

- I fully understand after this 6 months of study I will not be a data scientist

- Would I have enough knowledge?
- Would I have enough working knowledge to get a job as a junior data analyst/data scientist?
- Could I work my way up?
- What resources would you recommend for learning about Python and statistics, machine learning?
- Would my existing business skills count for much?

To be honest, I think the market right now is pretty much locked with tons of PhD’s from Maths, Statistics, Physics, etc.

Have you tried applying anywhere?

I think you’d find a lot of laces take you on raise you on your own if you are the right fit.
