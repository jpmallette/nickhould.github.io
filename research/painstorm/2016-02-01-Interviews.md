### Question

Finishing up Ph.D
Looking for jobs seriously
Last month attending data scientist interviews
Diversity of problems domains
Not-so-good experiences when data scientist job was misclassified for software engineer
Startups had the most well rounded interview processes
Mix of code, one on one to explain approach
Big companies interview felt rushed
attend as many interviews as possible before deciding on specific job


“Interviewing is one of the most desdful things”
“I am just an accounting undergrad trying to find a more analytics career path”
“If you’re lucky enough to get so many interviews”
“By your 10th you get pretty confident and can turn it more into a situation where you are interviewing them”
