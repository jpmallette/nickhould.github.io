### Question
“Education requirements to get into data science”
“I always see on here that M.S stats degree is better than MS data science”what about extensive programs like NYU’s or U of Rochester Data Science masters
“Would a 1 year stats degree really be better”
“if background in like mine which is bs Math and MS in Physics”
“is there any certificate that I can receive that will be sufficient”



### Answers
“impossible to say right now”
“Data Science programs only came into the forefront in the past 1-4 years so evidence won’t exist for determining for another few years”
“what you need to know:”
    “Programming (~85% want R or Python”
    “Statistics”
    “Machine Learning”
    “Data Exploration/Cleaning/Feature Engineering”
    “Have Projects Published”
    “Database Knowledge”

“If you’re going to grad school, asses their performance on those features”

“I would add one thing: continue learning”
“Schools can’t compete with state of art tech”
“it’s on you to learn”
“learn Scala”
“lean Spark’
“2 hours a night I’m dedicating myself to learning them”
“SQL, R and Python”

“same situation as me”
“I’m BS in Stats and Comp Sci”
“started a year ago R and SQL’
“Machine Learning”
“Where are you guys learning this stuff?
