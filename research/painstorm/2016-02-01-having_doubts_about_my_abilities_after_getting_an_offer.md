### Question:

“Having doubts about my abilities after getting an offer”
“statistician with six years of professional experience”
“laid off”
“been on the job market”
“competing for statistician, advances analytics and data science position over the past 1.5 months”
“social science background”
“pretty easy”
“data science offer”
“starting to have some reservations about skill set is adequate for position”
“passed their technical interview and other tests”
“not sure technical and quantitative skills are good enough”
“team is full of stats or CS PhD’s from Stanford”
“forced to move to a different state”
“what would you suggest”
“aim for the stars and do your best”
“or go bac to statistician or senior analyst”

### Answer:

“limited experience”
“moved to academia into data scientist almost a year ago”
“unlikely to be expected to suddenly be pushing out new fantastic models”
“time to get up to speed”
“study up on things”

“i feel very confident in the stats part, the CS part is where I am not solid:”
    “relational databases”
    “R”
    “Python”
    “it’s probably better than most analysts”
    “not sure it’s as good as most CS or DS folks”

“it’s tough finding people who know statistics well enough to talk it like a pro and have coding skills they are probably going to give you some time to get up to speed on the coding part”

### Analysis
#### What hurts?
- Doubts about computer science skills while transitioning from statistician to data scientist
- Doubts about technical skills and quantitative skills are good enough: R, Python, Relation Databases.
- Fear of new colleagues that are from top computer science schools.
#### What do they buy?
#### What do they want?
