title: Learning Machine Learning
---

For the last six years, I've been working professionally in the field of data science. My work has ranged from helping clients understand their website usage at a digital agency, building a monitoring tool for Tumblr bloggers, leading user acquisition at a venture-backed startup to finally work in data analysis and engineering at Intel Security. Through those different positions, there is one constant: I am intensively extracting value from raw data in order to drive decisions. 

During those years, I've been doing lots of data engineering, analysis and statistics. However, I rarely had to use machine learning algorithms in order to answer questions or resolve problems. It's crazy [how far you can go with basic statistics, quality data and the right questions](https://m.signalvnoise.com/data-scientists-mostly-just-do-arithmetic-and-that-s-a-good-thing-c6371885f7f6#.mdzol0bvc). People often underestimate this. 

As I progress in the field of data, I'm starting to notice many opportunities where my work could be enhanced with machine learning. Like many jobs, a part of the data analysis work is prone to be automated with artificial intelligence in the coming years. Machine learning has already [automated some of the data science tasks](http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/which-jobs-will-ai-artificial-intelligence-kill). 

## The Plan
In the next few months, I want to focus on learning machine learning. I'll be deep diving in the topic. I will write about my learnings in the process and I will share as much as possible with you. In the past, I've tackled with machine learning here and there. I took a few basic classes, skimmed through books and worked with colleagues to implement some machine learning models. I have a decent understanding of the different algorithms. I am not starting from zero but I have a long way to go.

### Why am I learning in public?
The main reason is that I want to share my learnings with you. There are many [studies](*http://ideas.time.com/2011/11/30/the-protege-effect/) that demonstrate the benefits of teaching in the learning process. I've been really inspired by people like Nathan Barry who teach everything they learn as they go.

To start with, I will take a hands-on approach. because I know this works best for me. I am not overlooking the theory behind machine learning. I'll get to that at some point in my learning process. The main resource I'll be starting with is a book called [Python Machine Learning](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1783555130/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1783555130&linkCode=as2&tag=nickhould-20&linkId=79334fab95b99f2021c47f06697c40c3) by [Sebastian Raschka](https://sebastianraschka.com/). Raschka shares a lot of knowledge on his blog and I like his style of writing. He has many public [Python Notebooks](https://sebastianraschka.com/notebooks/ml-notebooks.html) where he drops tons of knowledge about data science. The *Python Machine Learning* book was recommended to me by a few people I look up to. It will be my starting point.

Are you learning machine learning too? Do you have some recommendations? [Please drop me a note](mailto:jn@jeannicholashould.com).
