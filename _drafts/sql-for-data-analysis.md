title: SQL for Data Analysis
---

I've a had a few discussions over the past months with people wanting to get into data analysis. One of the most frequent question I get is: "What skills shoud I learn? Should I learn R or Python?". My answer to them is none of these for now. First learn SQL. 

### Why SQL?
SQL is the most common denominator for data analysis. It's a special-purpose programming language designed to interact with databases. It is ubiquitous. Every modern company stores data in a relational database and therefore uses SQL. As a data analyst you will inevitably interact with an SQL interface on a frequent basis. SQL is a simple language that gets the job done. You can learn the basics of SQL in a few hours and with those concepts you can powerfully wrangle your data, wether it's a few rows or millions of data points. Also, SQL is the defacto interface for querying data at scale. The Hadoop environment is being ruled by SQL. Redshift and other massive parallel processing data warehouse are interfacing in SQL. SQL has been here for decades and it's here to stay.

### Get your hands dirty
As with any skills, the best way to learn SQL is by getting your hands dirty. To get started, I'd suggest reading through [Learn SQL The Hard Way](http://sql.learncodethehardway.org/book/). While the book is not complete yet, it seems like a good reference to get started. It helps you get setup with a local version of SQLite and teaches you some basic commands to create, retrieve, update and delete data. Once you get more familiar with SQL, you can perhaps load up one of those [awesome public data sets](https://github.com/caesar0301/awesome-public-datasets) in your local SQLite instance and practice your skills on some real-world datasets.
